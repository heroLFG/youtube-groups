      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Welcome. My name is Lucas. For the longest time I had been wondering what I wanted to do with this channel, and I had a lot of trouble specifying my content. Today this hasn't changed much, but, I have found that podcasts are my strongest suit. I love speaking to people, connecting to them and learning from their perspectives. Subscribing to this channel will give you weekly conversations with people and topics worth listening to (I think). I also upload a bunch of short videos daily that may or may not be to please the algorithm and grow my channel. So likely you came through the shorts, but I sincerely hope you stay for the conversations.</p>
